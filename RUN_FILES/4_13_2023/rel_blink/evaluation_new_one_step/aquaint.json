        "sentence": "   THAILAND\n\n MORE and more people are dying or suffering from fatal diseases such as  brain tumours  , mammarian or  breast cancer   and brain  haemorrhage   due to a lack of proper medical care.However, things may change as the Srisiam Hospital in  Bangkok   has now established the first ever  Radio Surgery   Institute in  Thailand   -- (there are presently more than 100 radio surgery centres around the world). \n\n Radio surgery is a modern technique which doesn't require surgery in order to remove  cancerous   growth or  tissues  . It involves a  three dimensional   method known as  Stereotaxic Surgery  , which is also used in conjunction with  radiation   equipment known as the  Linear Accelerator  . \n\n With this new technology, doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery, every step is controlled by computers and patients are  conscious   while they undergo treatment. \n\n This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous  Malformation   (the  clotting   of veins or blood  capillaries  in the brain).So far, ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days. Additionally, there is no need for patients to shave their heads and radio surgery causes no scar, little blood loss and is not expensive.For more information contact the hospital at srisiam ksc.th.com. \n\n",

        "sentence": "   Businessman killed in Siberian town\n\n A  Russian   businessman was killed on his way to work Wednesday by an unidentified gunman in what appeared to be an  organized crime   killing, according to news reports. \n\n Yuri Zinin, the head of  Sibneft   Company was shot in the back as he walked out of his apartment building in the town of Leninsk-Kuzntesky in the  Kemerovo   region of central  Siberia  , Russian news agencies quoted local police as saying. \n\n Zinin's company has the same name as one of  Russia  's largest oil producers, Sibneft, controlled by controversial business  mogul    Boris Berezovsky  . But the two companies are separate. \n\n Zinin's Sibneft was locally-based and mostly involved in selling  oil products   and  coal  . Kemerovo is one of Russia's main  coal-mining   regions. \n\n Police launched a search for the killer who fled. Officials wouldn't comment on possible motives for the murder. \n\n There are hundreds of  contract murder  s in Russia every year as  mobsters   fight for control of profitable businesses. Only a small number of such killings are ever solved. \n\n The small town of  Leninsk-Kuznetsky   became known nationwide last year, when the city  mayor   was arrested on  tax fraud   and  embezzlement   charges. Mayor  Gennady Konyakhin  , also accused of being linked to the  mob  , is in custody awaiting  trial . \n\n (vi/ren) \n\n",

        "sentence": "   Iranian POW negotiator holds talks with Iraqi ministers\n\n The head of  Iran  's  prisoner of war   commission met with two  Iraqi Cabinet ministers   Saturday in a bid to glean information about thousands of Iranian POWs allegedly in Iraq, the official  Iraqi News Agency   reported. \n\n Iraqi Foreign Minister  Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf   told Abdullah al-Najafi that the two states needed to \"speed up the closure of what remains from the POW and  Missing-In-Action   file,'' INA said. \n\n The issue of POWs and missing persons remains a stumbling block to normalizing relations between the two neighbors. \n\n Iraq has long maintained that it has released all Iranian prisoners captured in the 1980-88  Iran-Iraq War  . The countries accuse each other of hiding POWs and preventing visits by the  International Committee of the Red Cross   to prisoner camps. \n\n The ICRC representative in  Baghdad  , Manuel Bessler, told The  Associated Press  that his organization has had difficulty visiting POWs on both sides on a regular basis. \n\n In April, Iran released 5,584 Iraqi POWs and Iraq freed three POWs and 316 Iranians it classified as civil law detainees in the largest exchange since 1990. \n\n More than 1 million people were killed or wounded in the Iran-Iraq War. \n\n",

        "sentence": "   Report: Plane robbed by gunmen in Nigerian airport\n\n An  Air Afrique    Boeing  -727 jet was the third passenger liner looted in the past month by armed robbers while awaiting takeoff at  Nigeria's largest international airport  , the  Lagos    Guardian newspaper   reported on Thursday. \n\n The thieves broke into the aircraft's luggage compartment and escaped with a large quantity of baggage as the plane was awaiting permission to take off from the Lagos international airport control tower around 9 p.m. on Tuesday night, the Guardian said. It was not clear where the airliner was destined. \n\n There was no immediate confirmation of the report. \n\n The plane's captain, who noticed the theft, sent a  distress call   that went unanswered by airport officials.  Security   personnel on duty later said said they were unable to capture the culprits because their only security vehicle had been taken away for routine maintenance. \n\n In another incident last week involving an unidentified passenger jet, landing gear worth dlrs 1 million was stripped from while the plane was waiting to take off, the newspaper said. In May, a  Cameroon Airlines   plane was robbed of its luggage after armed thieves blocked the plane on the  tarmac   with a large log. \n\n The robberies came despite orders from airport security officials to shoot suspected thieves on sight. \n\n  Nigeria  , Africa's most populous country, has a notoriously high rate of  violent crime  accompanied by a breakdown of law and order under years of military rule. \n\n (fa-gam) \n\n",

He was 74. \n\n Chakravarty was suffering from  brain cancer   and died in hospital on Saturday, his family said. \n\n  Politics   was his forte and his columns appeared in leading  Indian newspapers   and magazines. \n\n Chakravarty also started a weekly news magazine, \"Mainstream,'' in 1962 and edited it for more than three decades. \n\n Last year, the government appointed him chief of  Prasar Bharati  , an autonomous  corporation   set up to end government control of radio and television. \n\n Chakravarty declined a top government award in 1990, saying no journalist should be identified with the governing establishment. \n\n He graduated from  Calcutta University   and studied at  Oxford University's Merton College   in England. \n\n Chakravarty taught history at Calcutta University in the 1930s before taking to  journalism   as correspondent of a weekly brought out by the  Communist Party of India  . \n\n He later joined the CPI and remained a member until 1978. \n\n He closed the Mainstream weekly for a while when Prime Minister  Indira Gandhi  imposed emergency rule in India 1975-77, jailing political opponents and imposing censorship on newspapers and magazines. \n\n Chakravarty was born November 3, 1913, in India's northeastern state of Assam. \n\n",

EVN must work out corrective measures based on his instructions, and individual leaders have to do  self-criticisms  . \n\n Khai said the utility has plenty of problems, particularly in the  tender   process and  project accounting  , that have led to complaints and affect Vietnam's reputation with foreign investors. \n\n In March, former President  Le Duc Anh  , in an article for the Army newspaper, criticized irregularities in the bidding process for the country's largest thermal electric plant. \n\n Local media have reported that the company has overblown the costs for construction and repair work on a number of projects to justify overcharging for electricity. \n\n Vietnam is chronically short of power, and several projects to raise its output are bogged down in bureaucracy. \n\n EVN imposed  rotating power cuts   earlier this year as the worst  drought   in a century dropped water levels to critical levels at the  reservoir  s that feed key  hydroelectric  plants. \n\n",

Starting in 2001, Lufthansa boss Juergen Weber hopes to eliminate such short hops _ between Frankfurt and  Cologne  , for example _ thus freeing up takeoff and  landing slots   for more lucrative international flights. \n\n As part of the Lufthansa- Deutsche Bahn   deal, passengers could check their luggage through at the train station for the Lufthansa flight they will catch at Frankfurt. \n\n The service is already in place at Saarbruecken, although travelers must drop their bags off the day before. Starting in September, the service will be extended to five other cities: Duesseldorf, Cologne,  Bonn  ,  Wuerzburg   and Nuremberg. \n\n Passengers flying on Lufthansa partners  United   and  SAS  would also be able to use the service, he said. \n\n The airline and railway said they'd form a working group to resolve such problems as security checks on the luggage and making sure the bags get to the airport from the train station on time. \n\n Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said his railway also would work to coordinate schedules better with Lufthansa flights to make connections easier, and allow for combined train and plane tickets.

Their harvest will be full of thorns and the outcome will be a taste of bitterness.'' \n\n The president delivered his speech in a black suit. He had decreed that Saturday be celebrated as a day of victory over Iran, and an  artillery   salute of 101 guns boomed over  Baghdad   in the early morning. National radio and television played  patriotic  songs for the occasion. \n\n Saddam spoke, 7th graf pvs \n\n",

It also raised fears of  copycat   attacks. \n\n Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of  sodium azide  , a chemical used in many industrial products, including  air-bag   mechanisms, said police spokesman Masashi Toma. \n\n The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition, but three suffered mild  liver disorders   Tuesday, said Yasuo Hirose, an official at the  Niigata City   Hospital. \n\n The  March 1995    nerve gas   attack on Tokyo subways carried out by the  Aum Shinri Kyo  religious cult has made Japan particularly wary of poisoning incidents. The subway gassing killed 12 people. (js) \n\n",

        "sentence": "   Stolen painting in  New Zealand   recovered, one man arrested\n\n A 19th-century painting worth U.S. dlrs 1 million stolen from  Auckland Art Gallery   nine days ago has been recovered, police said Monday. \n\n Senior Sgt. Gary Allcock said he understood that one person had been arrested over the theft of the 1874 oil, \"Still on Top,'' by French-born artist  Jacques-Joseph (James) Tissot  , one of New Zealand's most expensive and popular European works. \n\n He said details would be disclosed later. \n\n The painting valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1 million was stolen Aug. 9 by a man armed with a  shotgun   in a daring robbery at the  Auckland   Art Gallery. \n\n The man, clad in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet, dark visor and gloves, burst through the main door with a sawed-off shotgun and a  crowbar  . \n\n Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey Gallery waving a  firearm   and yelling \"get down,'' and \"keep back'' to staff and patrons. \n\n She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to the Lower Wellesley Gallery, where the painting was displayed. \n\n The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on the ground. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the frame and take it off the backing board. \n\n The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the gallery into  Albert Park , pursued by a member of the public. He was believed to have climbed on a motorcycle and escaped via a nearby highway. \n\n",

The court has been negligent,'' Watanabe told the  Tokyo District Court  . \n\n The prosecutors say Asahara, accused of masterminding the subway gassing, decided on the attack on March 18, 1995 while riding in a car with his followers. \n\n But Watanabe pointed out that top cultist Yoshihiro Inoue, a key witness for the  prosecution , told the court that Asahara was still undecided on the timing of the attack at that time. Inoue quoted Asahara as saying that he needed to meditate about it. \n\n Last April, the defense raised similar objections, but the prosecutors refused to change their statement. (cw) \n\n",

The fair is scheduled from Oct. 1 to 11. \n\n This is the second consecutive year that Iraq is attending the  Tehran   International Trade Fair, and points at the need for the two neighbors to do business despite their traditional animosity. \n\n Iran and Iraq fought an  eight-year war   which ended with a  U.N.  -brokered cease-fire. \n\n Iran claims Iraq still holds 4,000  prisoners of war   while Iraq says Iran is holding about 20,000 prisoners. More than 1 million people were killed or wounded on both sides during the 1980-88 war. \n\n Tehran accuses  Baghdad   of helping Iranian opposition groups and the two sides accuse each other of allowing infiltrators to sneak across their borders for  acts of sabotage  . \n\n In December, Iraqi Vice President  Taha Yassin Ramadan   became the highest-ranking Iraqi to visit Tehran since the  1991 Gulf War   when he attended the  Organization of the Islamic Conference  meeting. ti/vj \n\n",

Some 600,000 were killed in  the Holocaust  . \n\n When the communists assumed full power in 1948, they started a wave of nationalizations that spared no one, including the Jewish community. \n\n On June 20, 1997, a similar agreement, the first of its kind, was signed between the Hungarian government and the  Vatican . \n\n (ab/rp) \n\n",

He said these new challenges require increased cooperation, particularly through Interpol. \n\n The police officials are expected to discuss a  strategic development plan  aimed at making Interpol more proactive by re-examining the needs of the group's 177-member states, Kanemoto said. \n\n Details of, graf 8 pvs \n\n",

The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services. \n\n  South African Broadcasting Corp.   radio said it had been leaked a \"preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid. \n\n An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance \"informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations.'' \n\n Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment. \n\n The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month. The panel refused, to avoid appearing embarrassed. \n\n The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of  land mines   on border farms, abuses at its military camps in  Angola  and bombings. \n\n (djw) \n\n",

Many were tortured and others killed. \n\n The commission can grant  amnesty   to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty. \n\n Earlier this year, Botha was convicted of  contempt of court   for refusing to testify before the commission.

British and American officials hosted meetings in  London   last month of 16 Iraqi dissident groups in a bid to promote cooperation among them. \n\n \"This is a very dangerous issue ... No state in the world has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of any other country,'' Khaddam said. \n\n Habibi said the Iraqi and  Palestinian   questions were of great concern to Iran and Syria: \"There should be coordination between the two countries over these issues.'' \n\n The official Iranian news agency, IRMA, said the Iraqi and Palestinian issues would be the focus of talks between Habibi and Khaddam at the meeting of the Syrian-Iranian Supreme Committee. The committee meets biannually to promote cooperation in foreign affairs, trade and technology. \n\n Habibi, who is accompanied by  Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi  , is expected to meet Syrian President  Hafez Assad   during his three-day visit. \n\n Syria is Iran's closest Arab ally and supported the Persian state during the 1980-88  Iran-Iraq war . str-bm-jbm \n\n",

He granted temporary custody to the  National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  . \n\n But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to  Switzerland  , Trittin last week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos. \n\n Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don't come to Germany. \n\n Norbert Otto, a federal lawmaker from Erfurt, demanded in  parliament   Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals from being  put to sleep   in South Africa. \n\n In addition, the cultural minister of  Saxony , of which Dresden is the capital, asked the state's 740,000 school children to write letters of protest urging Tritten to allow the elephants into Germany.

Why not a $9 million  Rembrandt   painting? \n\n \n\n  Sotheby  's, the  New York    auction house  , said Tuesday that it will spend $25 million to launch sothebys.com, an Internet site where the public will be able to bid on  antiques  , art, jewelry,  sports memorabilia   and other  collectibles  . \n\n \n\n The value of items on the virtual auction block initially will be capped at about $10,000. More expensive items will be posted when imaging technology improves enough to give clear views of items from multiple angles. \n\n \n\n \"There's no point in having a fuzzy image on a $100,000 item,'' said Susan Solomon, head of the new venture. \n\n \n\n Sotheby's first major  online auction  , planned for July, will feature  baseball   memorabilia. \n\n \n\n While online auction sites have become extremely popular, consumer groups say the sites have produced more consumer complaints than any other Internet category because of shoddy merchandise and other fraud. \n\n \n\n Sotheby's said it would only sell merchandise from the auction house itself or reputable art dealers. And bids will only be accepted from customers who have registered their  charge card   numbers in advance. \n\n \n\n Officials at  Christie 's, another leading New York auction house, said they were also considering an online auction site. \n\n",

Paul Getty Museum   is returning three ancient  works of art   to  Italy   after determining they were stolen. \n\n \n\n One  sculpture   sat in its  collection   for 17 years. The objects will be flown to Italy this week, along with pieces that were loaned to the museum for an  antiquities   exhibit, according to a statement issued by the Getty on Monday. \n\n \n\n The stolen items are a terra cotta drinking cup from 480  B.C.  , found to have been illegally  excavated   from an  archaeological site  ; a  torso   of the god  Mithras   from the  2nd century  , found to have been stolen from a private Italian collection; and the sculpted head of a victorious athlete, a 2nd century  Roman   copy of an earlier  Greek   work, which was apparently taken from the storeroom of a scientific excavation. \n\n \n\n For security reasons, the museum did not say how much the pieces are worth. \n\n \n\n Although nobody claimed the works, Getty decided to return them based on information supplied by experts in the field and in consultation with Italian officials. \n\n \n\n International concern has been growing about rampant  thefts   of priceless art from collections and the  looting   of archaeological sites. \n\n \n\n The billion-dollar museum, located on a hill in the  Brentwood  area, opened in 1997. \n\n",

        "sentence": "    Astronomers   Spot Storm on Mars\n\n WASHINGTON (AP) -- A  cyclone   four times the size of  Texas   raged across the northern polar region of the planet  Mars   last month, according to  space telescope   views of the red planet. \n\n \n\n The  Space Telescope Science Institute   announced today that the  Hubble Space Telescope   on April 27 spotted an immense  Martian   storm cloud, made up of water  ice  , that was 1,100 miles long and 900 wide. \n\n \n\n Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a 200-mile wide eye in the center of the storm, taking on a shape that resembled  hurricanes   on  Earth  , astronomers said. \n\n \n\n The storm occurred during the summer in Mars' northern hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that caps the  Martian north pole   during part of the year. \n\n \n\n Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the  Viking Orbiter   spacecraft. \n\n \n\n Astronomers used a  wide field planetary camera   on Hubble to photograph Mars during the planet's closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years. \n\n \n\n Two pictures, taken six hours apart on April 27, showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture, the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up. \n\n \n\n Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm, and astronomers said it could have been a short-lived  phenomenon . \n\n",

The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage. \n\n \n\n The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday. \n\n \n\n His only visible wound was a single bite to the head, said Bruce Bartley, a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife Conservation. \n\n \n\n State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed. \n\n \n\n Troopers said Cates' .280-caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body, along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal. \n\n \n\n \"We don't know if one was a warning shot and one real, or if there were two real shots,'' Bartley said. \n\n \n\n Cates' death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8, 1998, when  Audelio Luis Cortes  , 40, was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the  Swanson River    oil field   near  Kenai .

The company stumbled on the e-mail when the volume of messages became so heavy it slowed down a  server  . \n\n \n\n One employee fired within the past week from the bank's  home-equity   division was called into an office, shown a stack of e-mail and fired on the spot, an employee told the newspaper. \n\n \n\n First Union, a  Fortune 100   corporation, joins a number of companies taking swift and severe action for violations of company e-mail policy. \n\n \n\n Companies are seeking to protect themselves from  legal claims   that their work environment is hostile. An increasing number of lawsuits alleging  sexual harassment  have based claims in part on e-mails taken from company computer systems. \n\n",

About 6,000 passengers were cleared from the terminal during the search, airline officials said. \n\n \n\n Eighty more flights were canceled today and numerous others were delayed as the effects of the shutdown lingered, Price said, adding that the carrier hoped to be back to a normal schedule by this afternoon. \n\n \n\n The man was not found and Chicago police said officers turned up nothing suspicious. \n\n \n\n He was leaving a  concourse   and heading toward the  baggage claim  area when he turned back and ran up a one-way staircase leading to the concourse, United spokesman Matthew Triaca said. Guards are stationed at the staircase, but the man ran past them. \n\n \n\n No United flights left the terminal during the search and only a few landed at other United gates.

He was 58. \n\n Garcia joined The Associated Press office in Managua in 1986 after working for  Radio Nicaragua  , where he was director of  short-wave   broadcasts, and after helping found a local news agency, Agencia de Noticias Nueva Nicaragua. \n\n For the AP, he covered the war between the  Sandinista   government and  Contra   rebels, the Sandinistas' loss of power at the ballot box and the country's sometimes turbulent effort to put years of war behind it. \n\n He also reported on  volcanic eruptions  , the 1996 visit of  Pope John Paul II   and the ravages of  Hurricane Mitch   in 1998. \n\n ''He worked under very difficult conditions created by a civil war but always managed to maintain total objectivity and a fair vision under pressure in reporting for The Associated Press,'' said Eloy Aguilar, the AP bureau chief for  Mexico   and  Central America  . \n\n Garcia was born in Nandasmo, a town about 15 miles south of Managua. He attended the  National Autonomous University of Nicaragua  . \n\n Garcia suffered a series of illnesses last year, including  diabetes   and  cancer . He died Saturday night. \n\n He was buried in Nandasmo on Sunday. He is survived by his wife, Ana Leonor Hernandez, and four daughters. \n\n",
