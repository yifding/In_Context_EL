It also raised fears of  copycat   attacks. \n\n Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of  sodium azide  , a chemical used in many industrial products, including  air-bag   mechanisms, said police spokesman Masashi Toma. \n\n The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition, but three suffered mild  liver disorders   Tuesday, said Yasuo Hirose, an official at the  Niigata City   Hospital. \n\n The  March 1995    nerve gas   attack on Tokyo subways carried out by the  Aum Shinri Kyo  religious cult has made Japan particularly wary of poisoning incidents.

Inoue quoted Asahara as saying that he needed to meditate about it. \n\n Last April, the defense raised similar objections, but the prosecutors refused to change their statement. (cw) \n\n",

The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era's abuses on white governments and their brutal security services. \n\n  South African Broadcasting Corp.   radio said it had been leaked a \"preliminary document'' which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid. \n\n An ANC spokesman, Thabo Masebe, said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance \"informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations.'' \n\n Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment. \n\n The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month.
